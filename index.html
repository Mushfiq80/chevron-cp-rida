                <h1>About Chevron</h1>
                <p>Chevron Corporation, a global leader in the energy sector, has a significant presence in
                    Bangladesh, focusing on oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing.
                    Established as the Pacific Coast Oil Company in 1879, Chevron expanded its operations
                    globally, including in Bangladesh in the mid-1990s after acquiring Unocal. The company
                    operates three major gas fields in Bangladesh, collectively supplying over 60% of the country&#39;s
                    natural gas demand and 80% of its condensate production. Chevron&#39;s mission is to provide
                    reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy to improve people&#39;s lives and meet the world&#39;s
                    growing
                    energy needs. The company operates with a decentralized organizational structure, divided into
                    upstream and downstream segments. In Bangladesh, Chevron&#39;s operations are managed by a
                    local subsidiary, which collaborates closely with government agencies and other stakeholders.</p>

                            During my internship at Chevron Bangladesh, I worked on a range of tasks within the IT
                            department, focusing primarily on data analytics, cybersecurity, and virtual infrastructure
                            management. The most interesting aspect of my role was the hands-on experience with Power
                            BI, where I created and optimized dashboards that supported critical decision-making
                            processes. Additionally, I had the opportunity to delve into cybersecurity practices,
                            gaining insights into threat detection and response.

                                academic background provided a foundation, but the hands-on experience was invaluable.
